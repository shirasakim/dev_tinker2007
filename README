This directory contains some codes to compute the radial pairwise velocity profile of galaxies as in Tinker 2007 (arXiv:astro-ph/0604217)
Just "make" for compiling and you will get an executive file named as calc_tinker07.
Please see sub.sh how to run this executive file. Note that you need the GSL for compiling.
